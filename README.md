# speed-overlap-game

The objective of this game is to align the circles. To be more specific, for each round there will be a circle randomly generated by variating radius. The circle will be centered in the middle of the scree, but its size will differ every round. You, as a player, have to align your circle by resizing it and adjusting it to the generated circle. The resizing will be carried out by moving the potentiometer. So, when you move the potentiometer to the right, the circle gets bigger, and when you move the potentiometer to the left, the circle gets smaller. You will repeat this until you have successfully overlapped 3 circles in total. You will be timed each round on your performance and the completion time will be posted on the scoreboard.

To talk a bit about the design and the location of different elements, you will see a scoreboard on your left that is updated after every 3 circles, and you will also be able to see how many circles you have aligned so far on the right-hand side. On the top segment, you will see the time. Most importantly, you will see the two circles in the center.  Without further ado, enjoy!
